# Demo-Repo

This is the repo I will use to do demos and to test various things. I'm currently on a journey to master devops concepts and trying new things. 

## My-blog

I will be deploying a wordpress blog using Terraform and AWS. I wanted a blog for a while to share projects and documentations on how I achieved those and I tought using IaC to do it would help me if I ever need to scale the infrastructure effortlessly.
